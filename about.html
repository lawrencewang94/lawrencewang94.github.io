        Hi, my name is Lawrence and I'm a Machine Learning researcher. Welcome to my website!
	  </p>
		<p>
		I am a Physics and Philosophy student by training, and have kept up programming as a hobby since high school. My first introduction to Machine Learning was an attempt to solve Lunar Lander which I began tackling with a somewhat Classical-Mechanics point of view, but finished with a Reinforcement Learning method. Right now, I am focused on the classification of mosquitoes from acoustic audio with the Humbug team at the University of Oxford. 
		</p>
		<p>
		I am very excited to engage on projects in Machine Learning or Algorithmic Trading. Please feel free to browse the <a class="about_me_links" href="/projects">projects</a> section to see what I've experimented with, <a class="about_me_links" href="/contact">shoot me an email</a> or connect on <a class="about_me_links" href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/lawrence-wang-331a79b8/">LinkedIn</a>.
